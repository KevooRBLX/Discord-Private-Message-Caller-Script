Introducing the Discord DM Caller with Script feature! It's a handy tool that lets you make direct voice calls to someone on Discord while using a pre-written script.

To get started, make sure you have the latest version of Discord installed on your device. You can find the DM Caller with Script feature right inside the Discord app.

When you want to make a call, make sure you're looking at the channel of the friend you want to initiate the call with. Once you're in the channel, just run the main.js script, located in the main.js file [Duh].

Once you run the script, the call should be automatically started, and your friend will be able to join in. :D

[OPTIONAL]The scripting feature is great for saving time if you have it as a snippet in your dev tools console. Tutorials are on Youtube to make a snippet just find one and make one and insert the script into it so you can run it at a much faster speed without having it copied.

Remember, this version of the DM Caller supports scripts, but there might be updates in the future with even more features and improvements. Discord is always working to make things better for its users.

Note: This is against **Discord's TOS** as it is considered a **self-bot**. It is unlikely you will actually get terminated but still **USE AT YOUR OWN RISK**
